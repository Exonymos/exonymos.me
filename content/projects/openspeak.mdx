# OpenSpeak - A Voice-Enabled GPT-3 Chatbot
OpenSpeak is an interactive voice-enabled chatbot that leverages GPT-3 to provide conversational responses to your questions. Whether you're looking to chat, ask questions, or simply experiment with AI-driven conversations, OpenSpeak is designed to give you a seamless and engaging experience.

# How Does It Work
OpenSpeak listens to your voice through your computerâ€™s microphone and converts your speech to text using the SpeechRecognition library. This text is then sent to GPT-3, which generates a response. The response is read aloud using the pyttsx3 library, allowing for a fully voice-enabled conversation.

# How to Use OpenSpeak
**Download the Program:** Start by downloading the executable file provided in the repository.

**API Key Setup:** You'll need an API key from OpenAI to use GPT-3. When you first run the program, it will prompt you to enter your API key. You can generate or retrieve your API key from OpenAI.

**Start the Conversation:** After entering the API key, the program will prompt you to speak your question. Simply say your question out loud, and OpenSpeak will process and respond to it.

**Quit the Program:** If you want to stop the conversation, you can say "quit" or "exit" when prompted, and the program will close.

# Why OpenSpeak Exists
OpenSpeak was created to explore the possibilities of voice-enabled chatbots and AI-driven conversations. By combining the power of GPT-3 with voice recognition technology, OpenSpeak offers a unique and interactive experience for users to engage with AI in a conversational manner.

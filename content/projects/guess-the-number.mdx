# Test Your Luck: Guess the Number Game
Guessing games are a classic way to test your luck and intuition, and this "Guess the Number Game" is no exception. It challenges you to guess a number between 1 and 100 with simple and intuitive gameplay. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this game is perfect for a quick break or to sharpen your guessing skills.

# How It Works
The game was created using core web development technologies:

- HTML structures the game, providing a clean interface for input and feedback.
- CSS styles the game, making it visually appealing with dark and light mode options.
- JavaScript powers the game logic, generating random numbers, providing hints, and tracking your attempts.

Players enter their guess and receive feedback until they find the correct number. If you're unsure, use the "Hint" button to get a clue, and once you guess correctly, you can click "Play Again" to start a new game.

# Why Build This Game?
I developed this game as a fun project to practice JavaScript logic and DOM manipulation. It’s a simple but engaging challenge that anyone can enjoy. Plus, it’s a great way to showcase how straightforward web technologies can be used to create interactive experiences.

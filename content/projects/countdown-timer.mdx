# Simple Yet Functional: A Countdown Timer
Timers are essential tools for various tasks, from cooking to workouts, or even managing time for focused work sessions. I decided to create a simple yet effective countdown timer using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The result is a clean, responsive timer that gets the job done, complete with an alarm sound to notify you when the time is up.

# Building the Timer
The timer was built using basic web technologies: HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the logic. The JavaScript code handles the countdown mechanism, updating the timer display in real-time and triggering an alarm sound when the countdown reaches zero. The CSS ensures that the timer is visually appealing and responsive, making it usable on both desktop and mobile devices.

# Why I Created This
I built this countdown timer as a quick and practical project to sharpen my JavaScript skills. It’s a straightforward tool, but it allowed me to explore how to manipulate time-based events in the browser. Plus, it’s a handy utility to have around for everyday use.

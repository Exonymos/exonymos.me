# Test Your Knowledge: Quiz Game
Quizzes are a great way to challenge yourself and learn something new. My Quiz Game is designed to be both entertaining and educational, offering a wide range of questions on various topics. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this game provides a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to dive right into the quiz.

# How It Works
The Quiz Game is developed with the following technologies:

- HTML sets up the structure of the quiz, including the questions, answers, and feedback.
- CSS styles the quiz, creating a visually appealing and responsive design.
- JavaScript powers the game logic, managing the questions, scoring, and interaction with the player.

Players are presented with a series of questions and multiple-choice answers. At the end of the quiz, you'll receive a score based on your performance, giving you the opportunity to see how well you did and learn from any mistakes.

# Why I Built This Game
I developed this Quiz Game as a way to practice JavaScript and enhance my understanding of how to create interactive web applications. It’s a simple yet effective way to test your knowledge and have fun at the same time.

# A Basic Yet Handy Tool: Simple Counter
Counters are small yet incredibly useful tools that can help with a variety of tasks, from tracking inventory to counting repetitions during exercise. I created a simple counter using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, aiming for a clean and user-friendly interface. This counter allows you to increment, decrement, and reset the count with ease, and even features an "Advanced" button for additional functionality that adds more increment and decrement options.

# How It Was Built
This counter is constructed with the basics of web development:

- HTML provides the structure of the counter, laying out the buttons and display.
- CSS is used to style the counter, giving it a modern look with responsive design elements.
- JavaScript drives the functionality, handling the logic for incrementing, decrementing, and resetting the counter. The script also manages the "Advanced" button, which can be expanded for more options.

# The Purpose Behind It
I built this counter as a simple project to reinforce fundamental skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s a straightforward application but one that has practical uses in everyday tasks. Plus, it's a good starting point for anyone looking to learn or improve their web development skills.

# Try It Out and Customize

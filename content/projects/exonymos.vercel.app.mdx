Creating a personal website has always been on my list of things to do. It's a place where I can share my thoughts, showcase my projects, and experiment with the latest web technologies. With exonymos.vercel.app, I’ve aimed to design a site that’s not only functional but also visually appealing, utilizing some of the most powerful tools available in modern web development.

# The Stack Behind the Scenes
This website is built with Next.js, a React framework that enables fast and scalable web applications. For the styling, I chose Tailwind CSS, which allows me to build custom designs without leaving my HTML. To manage serverless data storage, I’m using Upstash, ensuring that the site remains fast and efficient. Lastly, I’ve integrated Contentlayer, which helps me seamlessly manage content across the site.

Deployed on Vercel, this setup ensures that the site is not only quick to load but also easy to maintain and scale as needed.

# Why This Site Exists
Like so many others, I just wanted a place to collect some projects I worked on. Whether it's a side project, a small experiment, or just something I’m proud of, I wanted a central hub where I can share my work with others. This site serves that purpose and more—it's a playground where I can continue to learn and refine my skills.

# Level Up Your Adventure: Genshin Impact AR Calculator
Adventure Rank (AR) is a crucial aspect of progressing in Genshin Impact, as it unlocks new content and rewards. However, knowing how much experience is needed to reach the next AR level can be a bit tricky. To help with this, I created the Genshin Impact AR Calculator, a simple yet effective tool that lets players calculate the exact amount of experience required to reach their desired AR level.

# Building the Calculator
This calculator was developed using the core web technologies—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The logic behind the calculator is straightforward, yet it provides accurate and helpful results for players who are focused on efficiently managing their experience gains in the game.

- HTML sets up the structure, making it easy to input your current AR and the target AR.
- CSS styles the tool, ensuring it’s easy on the eyes and consistent with the Genshin Impact theme.
- JavaScript handles the calculations, instantly providing the user with the necessary experience points to reach the next level or their target AR.

# Why I Created This Tool
As a fan of Genshin Impact, I found it useful to have a tool that could quickly and accurately calculate the AR experience needed to level up. It’s a small utility, but it can save players time and help them plan their progression in the game. Plus, it was a fun project that allowed me to combine my love for the game with my passion for coding.

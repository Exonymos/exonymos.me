# Bringing Connect 4 to the Web
Connect 4 is a timeless classic, a game that brings back fond memories for many of us. I wanted to recreate this experience for the web, so I decided to build a Connect 4 game using React. The result is a sleek, responsive version of the game that you can play directly in your browser.

# The Technology Behind the Game
This project was built using React, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture allowed me to break down the game into manageable pieces, making it easier to develop, test, and refine. The game logic is handled with state management to ensure smooth gameplay, while the UI is designed to be simple and intuitive.

# Why I Built This
I built this project as a way to explore React and its capabilities. By building a game like Connect 4, I was able to dive deep into React's component model, state management, and event handling. This project helped me understand my React skills and gain a better understanding of how to build interactive web applications.

# Try It Out and Contribute
You can play the game right now by visiting the link. If you're interested in the code behind the game, or if you have suggestions for improvements, feel free to explore the GitHub repository. I'm always open to feedback and contributions from the community.
